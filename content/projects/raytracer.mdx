A ray tracing project, built following the [Ray Tracing in a Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book.

This was my first real, practical introduction to anything resembling graphics programming.

Some of the benefits to doing this project:

-   Gained a better understanding of how programs evolve over time to meet requirements; adding classes and refactoring when necessary.
-   Gained a better understanding of physics, geometry, ray tracing and its quirks as it relates to graphics programming.

Now that I'm more familiar with some of the concepts surrounding ray-tracing, I would love to remake this in the future without the book hand-holding me most of the way through.
